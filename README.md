GildedRose application 

The Gilded Rose is an inventory management system for a small inn that buys and sells goods. Each item has two key values:

SellIn (days left to sell the item)

Quality (how valuable the item is)

The system updates these values daily, with rules that vary depending on the type of item:

Normal items degrade in Quality daily, and twice as fast after the sell-by date.

Aged Brie increases in Quality over time.

Backstage passes increase in Quality as the event approaches, but drop to 0 after the concert.

Sulfuras is legendary, with constant Quality (80) and no SellIn change.

Conjured items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items.

Quality is always between 0 and 50, except for Sulfuras. 

The task is to update the system to handle new rules,

especially for conjured items, without modifying the core Item class or Items property.
